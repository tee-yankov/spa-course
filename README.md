#A simple intro application to SPAs.

## Prerequisites:
* Vagrant
* VirtualBox (or any other support provider)

## How-To:
Execute the following commands in the project's root folder:

    vagrant up
Then wait a few minutes for the vagrant box to be installed. This might take a long time the first time but will be faster afterwards.
After that's done:

    vagrant ssh

And you should have a server going on port 4567. You can access it by navigating your browser over to
[http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)
